			Question #1: Turning Strings to URLs
			URLs cannot have spaces. Instead, all spaces in a string are replaced with %20. Write an algorithm that replaces all spaces in a string with %20.

			You may not use the replace() method or regular expressions to solve this problem. Solve the problem with and without recursion.

			Example
			Input: "Jasmine Ann Jones"

			Output: "Jasmine%20Ann%20Jones"


Notes:

Using Recursion:

I can go in two different routes to accompolish recursion. one being a nested function and the other is a series of if statements.  Both of which would call back on themselves.

// Function to take in a string (str) 
// declare i = 0
// declare output = ""
// create second function to take an argument of the declared index value of (0) and output variable
	// if statement that checks if (str[i]!=== " " && i <= str.length)
		// add str[i] to end of output.
		// increment i
		// return second function
	// if statement that checks if (str[i] === " " i <= str.length)
		add "%20" to end of output
		return second function
// outside the if statements return output;


Not Using Recursion:
// Function to take in a string (str) and an index position (i)

split(" ")
join("%20")
return

Question #2: Array Deduping
Write an algorithm that removes duplicates from an array. Do not use a function like filter() to solve this. Once you have solved the problem, demonstrate how it can be solved with filter(). Solve the problem with and without recursion.

Example
Input: [7, 9, "hi", 12, "hi" 7, 53]

Output: [7, 9, "hi", 12, 53]

Notes:

Using Recursion:
// Function to take in an array (arr) and an index position (i)
// Use an if statement to check if i is undefined if it is then define i to equal 0
// if statement to check 

Not Using Recursion:

			Question #3: Compressing Strings
			Write an algorithm that takes a string with repeated characters and compresses them, using a number to show how many times the repeated character has been compressed. For instance, aaa would be written as 3a. Solve the problem with and without recursion.

			Example
			Input: "aaabccdddda"

			Output: "3ab2c4da"

Notes:

Can I assume that its considering lowercase characters and uppercase characters as different things?



Using Recursion:


things I need to track.  
	input string
	index = str.length
	currentLetter = ""
	repeat = 0
	output
	
function compress(str, i, letter, repeat, output) {
	if (letter === str[i]) {
		repeat++;
		return function();
	}
	else if (i !=== 0) {
		if (repeat > 1){
			output = repeat.concat(output);
			}
		letter = str[i]
		output = letter.concat(output);
		repeat = 1;
		return function(str, i, letter, repeat, output);
	}
return output;
}


// change the name of repeat to occurance so it is more readable



// Function to take in a string (str)  
// declare i = 0
// declare current
// declare output = ""
// create second function to take an argument of the declared index value of (0) and output variable
// if statement that 
Not Using Recursion:

function
for loop to pull out each one using slice and then search the new array for an occurance

			Question #4: Checking for Uniqueness
			Write an algorithm that determines whether all the elements in a string are unique. You may not convert the string into an array or use array methods to solve this problem. The algorithm should return a boolean.

			Example
			Input: "hello"

			Output: false

			Input: "copyright"

			Output: true

Q's
---
Do uppercase versus lower case characters count as unique?

function uniqueness(str, i, ) {
	// function that takes 

}



	
function uniqueness(str, i, letter) {
	function dupeFinder () {
		if (letter !=== str[i]) {
			
		}
		else if (letter === str[i]) {
			return false;
		}

	}

Question #5: Array Sorting
Write an algorithm that sorts an array without using the sort() method. There are many different sorting algorithms - take the time to read about the following:

Quick sort
Merge sort
Heap sort
Insertion sort
Bubble sort
Selection sort
You may implement any of the above algorithms (or your own) to solve the problem - as long as it doesn't use sort().

Example
Input: [9, 2, 7, 12]

Output: [2, 7, 9, 12]



Notes:

The algorithm that popped into my head but that makes sense because it's the simplest brute force method but also pretty slow.

Merge sort seems like a variation of bubble sort but I'm having a hard time understanding why it works when looking at an example.  

QuickSort seems to be a better version of quick sort.  I might attemp it in the whiteboard if I feel comfortable enough with bubble sort.

Using Bubble Sort:

	Create a function that takes an arr,i, finalCheck
		delcare i = 0
			if statement (arr[i] > arr[i++]) {
			//removing the position
				holder = arr.splice(i,1)
			// reinserting the position
				arr.splice(i++,0,holder)
			// incrementing through
				i++
				finalCheck = 0;
			//if at the end of the array then start over
				if (i === array.length) {
					i = 0
					return function
				}
				return function
			} 
			//increment if current position is correct
			else if (arr[i] < arr[i++]) {
				i++;
				finalCheck++;
				// if the array is being
					if (finalCheck === arr.length) {
						return output;
					}
				return function;
			}

		}
